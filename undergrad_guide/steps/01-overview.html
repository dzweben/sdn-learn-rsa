        <h2>What You Are Doing</h2>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>This project analyzes how social learning is represented in the brain. You will learn the dataset, the workflow, and the scripts that generate beta maps for RSA.</p>
          <p>We will build intuition first, then move into actual command-line execution in later steps.</p>

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>RSA asks how similar neural patterns are across conditions. In this project, those conditions are social interactions across runs and peers.</p>
          <p>The end goal is to test how well brain representations mirror the true peer structure, and how this differs with social anxiety.</p>
