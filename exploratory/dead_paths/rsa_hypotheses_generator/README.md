# RSA hypotheses generator (dead path)

This folder contains an early utility that generated an exhaustive set of RSA condition comparisons for the LEARN task.

Status: **dead path / archival reference**.
- It was useful as an early attempt to enumerate possible comparisons before the analysis direction was finalized.
- Kept here for traceability and potential reuse of small pieces.

Source:
- Originally lived in the standalone repo `dzweben/RSA_Coding`.
